Sometimes there is a custom to exchange small gifts in schools / companies beeween pupils / employees 
before Christmas or on St Nicholas Day.
Usually every person taking place in such event put his name in the box. 
Then everybody is drawing a random name from a box to know to whom he or she shall give a gift.
The common issue is that somebody draws his name and the drawing has to start over.

Application aims to solve problems like this.

Still work in progress...
